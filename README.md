Notes:
I'm considering turning this into a PC game (hence closed source for now).
Currently functions as a tool for randomly generating dungeon maps on a square grid.

Next steps include:
-Deterministic seeded generation.
-Tile-types customisable by input.
-Textured backgrounds.
-Lining up the 'exit tile' with the next 'entrance tile'


Further down the road:
 -Moving around the map, discovering it as you go.
 -Activation of (deterministic) random events.
 -More game mechanics.
   -Player stats.
   -Combat system.
   -Inventory system.
   -Magic system.
   -Levels

Way off down the road
  -Art
  -Bosses
  -Savegames? Rogelite?
  -Multiplayer?
